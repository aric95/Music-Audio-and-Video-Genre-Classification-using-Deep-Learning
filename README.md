Classification of Music Genres through both Audio and Video files using Deep Learning

While there are a variety of algorithms to classify genres of audios, there is very limited material on classifying music videos in particular. In this article, we explore multiple methods to classify music genres, both audio and video. We test multiple methods after extracting relevant features and finally compare to arrive at the best approach.

We test the following approaches.
- Music Audio Genre Classification
- Music Video Genre Classification using Image Frames
- Music Video Genre Classification using combined Audio and Image Features

This was done as our final project for the Advanced Machine Learning course as part of our MSBA'22 program at UT.
